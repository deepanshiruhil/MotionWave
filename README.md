# Motion Wave 
A website using machine learning neural network that makes use of hands in order to create sounds

Try it out [here](https:).


## Features
- Hand Gesture Control: Control pitch and melodic expression using MediaPipe’s hand tracking.
- Harmony Generation: Real-time 4-part harmony generation using a neural network.
- Audio Synthesis: Custom Web Audio API-based vocal synthesis engine with formant filtering.
- Dual hand interaction: Independent controls for pitch, and volume (dominant and non dominant respectively)


## Tech Stack
### Core Framework
- Next.js 15: modern UI+ framework+ app router support 
- React 19: efficient state managenment + rendering 
- TypeScript: Type-safe development+ complex audio+ ML logic 

### ML and Audio
- **MediaPipe Hands**: Google's low-latency hand tracking for consistent gesture detection.
- **Web Audio API**: High-performance audio synthesis and digital signal processing.
- **Web Workers**: Off-thread processing to maintain 60FPS UI performance.

### Styling
- **Tailwind CSS 4**: Cutting-edge utility-first styling for a premium, vintage aesthetic.

Built with Next.js, MediaPipe, and the Web Audio API.
